# React Projects

These are projects I built with React as a core technology. Some projects also utilize Firebase as a back-end service, database, and authentication system.

Implementations, designs, and functionalities are referenced from online course on Youtube and Udemy.

I've read and wrote all lines of code by myself to established utmost understanding about React.JS library.

It solidified my skill set not only on React.js but also all of front-end developemt concepts and ensure that I can recreate and implements more sophisticated functions and components with efiicient and maintainable code for future projects.
